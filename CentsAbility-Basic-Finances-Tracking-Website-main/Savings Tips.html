        <div class="tips">
            
            <h4>Create a Budget</h4>
            <p>Start by tracking your income and expenses. Creating a budget will give you a clear picture of where your money is 
            going and help you identify areas where you can cut back.</p>

            <h4>Set Savings Goals</h4>
            <p>Define specific savings goals, whether it's an emergency fund, a vacation, or a down payment for a home. Having clear 
            objectives will motivate you to save.</p>

            <h4>Automate Savings</h4>
            <p>Set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your savings account. This ensures that a portion of your income 
            goes toward savings without you having to think about it.</p>

            <h4>Cut Unnecessary Expenses</h4> 
            <p>Review your expenses and identify non-essential spending. Consider cutting back on dining out, 
            entertainment, or subscription services that you don't use frequently.</p>

            <h4>Shop Smart</h4> 
            <p>Look for deals, use coupons, and compare prices before making purchases. Shopping during sales and using cashback or 
            rewards programs can also save you money.</p>

            <h4>Limit Credit Card Use</h4>
            <p> Try to use cash or a debit card for everyday expenses. High-interest credit card debt can be costly in the long run.</p>

            <h4>Emergency Fund</h4>
            <p> Build an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses. Having this safety net can prevent you from going into debt when 
            unexpected costs arise.</p>

            <h4>Use Public Transportation</h4>
            <p> If possible, use public transportation or carpool to reduce fuel and maintenance costs associated with owning a car.</p>

            <h4>Avoid Impulse Buying</h4>
            <p> When shopping, stick to a list and avoid making impulse purchases. Impulse buying can lead to overspending.</p>
